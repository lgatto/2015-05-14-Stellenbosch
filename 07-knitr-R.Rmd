**This content is adapted from the [RStudio R Markdown - Dynamic Documents of R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Markdown basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) [R code chunks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html) and tutotials.**

R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of
dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the
core syntax of
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) (an
easy-to-write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks that are
run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown
documents are fully *reproducible* (they can be automatically
regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).


This document describes R Markdown v2 based on
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). This implementation
brings many enhancements to R Markdown; we will focus the generation
of HTML, PDF and MS Word documents.

Note that PDF output requires a full installation of TeX.

> We would also like to warn against MS Word, and this breaking the
> support for reproducibility. The final, compiled document should be
> used to rendering; editing should be performed on the original
> documents.

### Installation

You can install the R Markdown package from CRAN as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

### Markdown Basics

Markdown is a simple formatting language designed to make authoring
content easy for everyone. Rather than writing complex markup code
(e.g. HTML or LaTeX), Markdown enables the use of a syntax much more
like plain-text email. For example the file on the left shows basic
Markdown and the resulting output on the right:

![Markdown overview](./img/markdownOverview.png)


#### Emphasis

```
*italic*   **bold**

_italic_   __bold__</code></pre>
```

#### Headers

```
## Header 2

### Header 3
```

#### Lists

Unordered List:
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
```
Ordered List:
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
```

#### Links
Use a plain http address or add a link to a phrase:
```
http://example.com

[linked phrase](http://example.com)
```

#### Images

Images on the web or local files in the same directory:
```
![alt text](http://example.com/logo.png)

![alt text](figures/img.png)
```

#### Blockquotes

```
A friend once said:

> It's always better to give
> than to receive.
```

#### Plain Code Blocks

Plain code blocks are displayed in a fixed-width font but not evaulated

```
This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
```

#### Inline Code

```
We defined the `add` function to
compute the sum of two numbers.
LaTeX Equations
```

#### Horizontal Rule / Page Break

Three or more asterisks or dashes:
```
'******

------
```

#### Tables

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

#### Miscellaneous

```
superscript^2^

~~strikethrough~~
```

#### Embedding Equations

You can embed LaTeX or MathML equations in R Markdown files using the
following syntax:

* `$equation$` for inline equations (note there must not be white
  space adjacent to the `$` delimiters)
* `$$ equation $$` for display equations
* `<math>...</math>` for MathML equations.

For example:

![Equation Inline](./img/equations_inline.png)

### R Code Chunks

Within an R Markdown file, R Code Chunks can be embedded using the
native Markdown syntax for fenced code regions. For example, the
following code chunk computes a data summary and renders a plot as a
PNG image:

![Markdown Chunk](./img/markdownChunk.png)

#### Basic Usage

R code chunks can be used as a means render R output into documents or
to simply display code for illustration. Here is a simple R code chunk
that will result in both the code and it's output being included:

<pre><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
summary(cars)
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>


To display the output of a code chunk but not the underlying R code,
you specify the `echo=FALSE` option:

<pre><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>

Note that R code chunks can also be used to render plots. To display a
plot while omitting the code used to generate the plot you'd do this:

<pre><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>

To display R code without evaluating it, you specify the eval=FALSE chunk option:

<pre><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>

### Inline R Code

You can also evaluate R expressions inline by enclosing the expression
within a single back-tick qualified with `r`. For example, the
following code:

![Markdown Inline](./img/markdownInline.png)

Results in this output: "I counted 2 red trucks on the highway."

#### Table Output

By default data frames and matrixes are output as they would be in the
R terminal (in a monospaced font). However, if you prefer that data be
displayed with additional formatting you can use the `knitr::kable`
function. For example:

<pre><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>

Note the use of the `results='asis'` chunk option. This is required to
ensure that the raw table output isn’t processed furthur by knitr. The
kable function includes several options to control the maximum number
of digits for numeric columns, alignment, etc (refer to the knitr
package documentation for additional details).

### Rendering Output

There are two ways to render an R Markdown document into it's final
output format. If you are using RStudio, then the "Knit" command
(`Ctrl+Shift+K`) will render the document and display a preview of it.

If you are not using RStudio then you simply need to call the
`rmarkdown::render` function, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("input.Rmd")
```

Note that in the case using the "Knit" button in RStudio the basic
mechanism is the same (RStudio calls the `rmarkdown::render` function
under the hood).


### Output Options

R Markdown documents can contain a metadata section that includes both
title, author, and date information as well as options for customizing
output. For example, this metadata included at the top of an Rmd file
adds a table of contents and chooses a different HTML theme:

```
---
title: "Sample Document"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    theme: united
---
```

R Markdown has built in support for several output formats (HTML, PDF,
and MS Word documents as well as Beamer presentations). These formats
can also be specified in metadata, for example:

```
---
title: "Sample Document"
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
    highlight: zenburn
---
```

If you aren’t specifying format options you can also just use a simple format name:

```
---
title: "Sample Document"
output: pdf_document
---
```

Multiple formats can be specified in metadata:

```
---
title: "Sample Document"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    theme: united
---
```

If you are using `rmarkdown::render` then you can pass a format name
to `render` to select from the available formats. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
render("input.Rmd", "pdf_document")
```


You can also render all formats defined in an input file with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
render("input.Rmd", "all")
```
