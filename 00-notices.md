## Interaction

* ask **questions**, interupt us
* **sticky notes**: during and after the sessions
* talk to each other, help each other
* compare your solutions (there is not single right answer)

## Programme

* *Tentative* programme
* You define the pace and the content

## Programming

The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so
this introduction to R is built around a common scientific task:
**data analysis**.

Our real goal isn't to teach you R,
but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on.
We use R in our lessons because:

1.  we have to use *something* for examples;
2.  it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;
3.  it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and
4.  it has a large collection of external packages available for
    performing diverse tasks.

But the two most important things are
to use whatever language your colleagues are using,
so that you can share you work with them easily,
and to use that language *well*.
